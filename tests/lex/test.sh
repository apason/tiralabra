#there is test.cfg file which contains one row per test. each row consists of
#two parts: name of the source file, and expected sequenqe of tokens found.

#token sequence uses same values as the main program uses. 0 means operator,
#1 means reserved keyword etc.. full list of token types are declared in
#src/lex.h

#this test script runs the pregram with input of each file determined in test.c
#it cuts types of output token stream and compares it with expected value.
